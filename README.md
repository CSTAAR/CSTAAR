# CSTAAR (Computational Solutions for Terrestrial and Aquatic Archaeological Research)

**CSTAAR** is an independent research initiative focused on enhancing and streamlining digital workflows in archaeology through programming, computational tools, and emerging technologies.  

---

## Mission

CSTAAR aims to **improve efficiency, reproducibility, and scalability** of digital processes in archaeology by integrating:

- **Data analysis and automation**
- **Earth Observation (EO) technologies**
- **Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)**
- **Digital documentation and 3D data processing**
- **Big data analysis and visualization**

The project addresses both terrestrial and underwater contexts, with a strong emphasis on **methodological development** and the creation of reusable, open-source tools.

---

## Areas of Focus

- **Automation of archaeological workflows**  
  (e.g., digitization of analog documentation, data processing, GIS workflows)

- **EO-based analysis** for site detection and environmental context  
  (Sentinel-2, EnMAP, LULC, Object/Site Detection, OBIA, SDB, seabed classification)

- **Machine learning pipelines** for pattern recognition and segmentation

- **Big data processing and analysis** of multispectral/hyperspectral, DEM, and geospatial datasets

- **3D documentation** and interactive visualisation

- **Communication and presentation** of results using modern data viz methods

---

## Goals

- Enable archaeologists to adopt **efficient, scalable, and transparent** digital workflows  
- Bridge the gap between **traditional fieldwork and computational analysis**    
- Create an ecosystem of **open-source tools and workflows** that are well-documented and adaptable

## Repositories

This repository serves as a central hub. You’ll find links to subprojects and tools developed under the CSTAAR initiative:

## Get Involved

CSTAAR is an open and evolving initiative.  
I am currently looking for:

- **Collaborators** (individual or institutional)  
- **Research partnerships**  
- **Funding opportunities** to further develop EO-based methodologies

If you’re interested in data-driven archaeology or looking for computational solutions to your project, feel free to get in touch.
